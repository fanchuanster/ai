Problem Statement
Sheldon is going to a book fair where all the books are star-rated.
As he is interested in just two types of books: Horror and Sci-fi, so he would buy the books from these two categories only. He would want to buy at least one book from each category so as to maximize the total star-rating of his books. Also, the total price of the books should not exceed the amount of money that he can spend.
The output is -1 if it is not possible to buy at least one book from both the categories with the money that he has.

Write an algorithm to help Sheldon buy the books from both the categories.

Input
The first line of the input consists of an integer amount, representing the amount of money Sheldon can spend.

The second line consists of two integers -
numHorror and numH, representing the number of Horror books (H) and the number of values given for every horror book (X is always equal to 2), respectively.

The next H lines consist of X space-separated integers:
hrating and hprice, representing the star-rating and the price of each Horror book, respectively.

The next line consists of two space-separated integers -
numSciFi and numS, representing the number of SciFi books (S) and the number of values given for every SciFi book (X is always equal to 2), respectively.

The last S lines consist of X space-separated integers:
srating and sprice, representing the star-rating and the price of each SciFi book, respectively.

Output
Print an integer representing the total maximum star-rating of books bought by Sheldon.
If he cannot buy at least one book from both the categories, then print -1.

Constraints
1 ≤ numHorror ≤ 1000

1 ≤ numSciFi ≤ 1000

1 ≤ amount ≤ 10⁵

1 ≤ hrating, srating ≤ 10⁶

1 ≤ hprice, sprice ≤ 10⁵

numH = 2

numS = 2

Explanation:
Select 1st and 3rd book from Horror books.
Select 3rd book from Sci-fi books.
Total Price = 10 (Horror) + 30 (Sci-fi) = 40 ≤ 50
Maximum star-rating = 5 (Horror) + 6 (Sci-fi) = 11
(Actually based on example explanation, the chosen books must have 5 + 6 + 2 = 13 rating if multiple books are chosen; but each category needs at least one book, not just one.)
